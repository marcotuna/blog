A few months ago I acquired an Android TV Box and decided to install Meo Go to watch television without relying on the operator TV Box.  
The experience was way better, the application responsiveness compared to the regular operator tv box was outstanding.  
Here's the situation, I wanted to watch TV whether I am at home, traveling, or on holidays, ... But now every network that I was at was using Meo which is a requirement to use this service

Work in progress....
